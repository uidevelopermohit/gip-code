                                    The past decade has seen a significant surge in the incidence of large and uncontrolled wildfires. For example, in April 2020, the number of fire alerts around the world rose by 13% compared to 2019, a record year for fires. This increase of wildfires in ecosystems have immense impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, human well-being, livelihoods and national economies which are dependent on them. 
                                        A global analysis of forest area affected by fire between 2003 and 2012 identified approximately 67 million hectares burned annually. In 2015, around 98 million hectares of forest were affected by fires. These fires occurred mainly in the tropics, where they affected about 4 percent of the forest area. Climate change with average increase in the temperature from 0.8°C to 1.5°C has increased the forest fire frequency and intensity. America, EU, Australia, Indonesia, and Brazil have experienced mega-fires. Year 2022, Indonesia, in the Riau province due to forest fire, the government had to declare an emergency and call for urgent measures, including cloud seeding to induce rainfall. Similarly, Australia, suffered its worst fire season in history in 2019–2020, with an estimated 10.2 million ha burnt, including 8.19 million ha of native forest (FAO, 2022). As per the recent report, in India, there is a ten-fold increase in forest fires in the past two decades, and more than 62% of Indian states are prone to high-intensity forest fires (FSI, 2021).

                                    With climate change leading to drying of biomass and adding organic build-up over time the forest fires are enormous and are no longer beneficial to the forest health. According to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, annual carbon emissions from forest fires are in the range of 2.5 billion to 4.0 billion tons of CO2 (MoEFCC, 2018). Globally, the raging forest fires are affecting the wildlife habitats and biodiversity. These fires are also displacing millions of people and taking away livelihoods. 
                                        A forest fire can be divided into three phases- Grass, undergrowth and crown fires. Usually, grass and the dry undergrowth ignite first and are easy to control. If the fire reaches the treetops, especially in the case of conifers, leading to a crown or canopy fire it becomes considerably more difficult to control. (Read more)
                                        Globally, only around 4% of all forest fires have natural causes such as lightning. In all other cases, the anthropogenic origin of the fires is common. Often, the burned areas and with it the entire ecosystem with the plants and animals living within it, are irretrievably lost. During the last decades, both distribution and frequency of wildfires have been changing in many areas across the world, due to changes in climate, landscapes, or socioeconomic drivers. These drivers often work hand in hand. This is particularly important in areas where humans are the major source of ignitions and landscape change. 
                                        Nonetheless, the effects of those driving factors on wildfires vary across temporal and spatial scales, requiring spatio-temporal models capable of simulating the spatial and temporal fire patterns. Forest fire is a growing threat to communities around the world. Traditionally, reducing forest fire risk was co-managed by the administration and local communities. But over time the local communities have been sidelined to pave way for forest departments/ fire departments to manage the forest fire. However, community driven forest fire management can reduce the deaths of residents. The loss of property and damages to infrastructure can be hugely reduced, thus saving millions of taxpayers’ money.

                                            Restoration of forest fire impacted areas- Karnataka Forest Department, India

                                                Forest fire on a large scale changes the species composition due to proliferation of invasive alien weed species like Lantana camara. This results in suppression of native grass, herb, shrub and tree species in the long thereby reducing the biodiversity of forests.
