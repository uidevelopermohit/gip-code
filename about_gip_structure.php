                <p>The Ministerial Communique of the G20 Environmental Ministers Meet in Riyadh in 2020 defined the operating 
                    parameters of the G20 Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of Terrestrial 
                    Habitats. One of the key elements of the initiative was to establish a land conservation, sustainable management, 
                    and restoration website. The website was envisaged to contain the following:
                </p>
                <p><i class="icon-right-arrow"></i>&nbsp;Information on degraded lands, national and international commitments on land conservation and restoration </p>

                <p>Currently, this website, the Global Restoration Information Hub (GRIH), is in the design stage with discussions 
                    ongoing with global databases to improve interoperability. The website is expected to report data collected by 
                    UNCCD as a part of its reporting process (PRAIS 4) and other information reported to various institutions and
                     databases on land restoration.

                        <p>Indiaâ€™s presidency has identified Arresting Land Degradation, Accelerating Ecosystem Restoration and 
                            Enriching Biodiversity as one of the key priorities for deliberation as a part of the Environment and 
                            Climate Sustainability Working Group. The presidency has committed to a decisive, inclusive and 
                            action-oriented approach to enable the achievement of the G20 voluntary ambition of reducing land 
                            degradation by 50% with the following objective:

                        <p>Full ecological restoration is the act of restoring a landscape to ensure the habitat is able to sustain its 
                            keystone species. A landscape approach for the restoration and reclamation of degraded land will ensure 
                            sustainable and equitable land use while strengthening measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

                    <p>The vision for the Gandhinagar Information Platform is to encourage increased cooperation between G20 countries
                         on sharing best practices on landscape restoration, technology transfer and mobilizing finance for the priority
                          landscapes of forest-fire-impacted areas and mining-affected areas. This platform will aim to integrate best 
                          practices of citizen and community engagement including successful land restoration projects along with
                           traditional knowledge and practices to prevent landscape degradation, accelerate ecosystem restoration
                            and enrich biodiversity
                    </p>
                    <p>The Gandhinagar For anformation Platform (GIP) that is proposed will enhance the Global Restoration Information
                         Hub (GRIH) under the G20 Global Land Initiative. The GIP will be specific to the priority landscapes selected
                          under the Indian Presidency i.e., forest fire-impacted areas and mining-affected areas. The hub will broadly
                           comprise and cover the following components:

                        areas and mining-affected areas, information on the nodal institutes/agencies and knowledge bases
