                        and restoration website. The website was envisaged to contain the following:

                        and
                        action-oriented approach to enable the achievement of the G20 voluntary ambition of reducing

                    <p>Full ecological restoration is the act of restoring a landscape to ensure the habitat is able
                        to sustain its
                        keystone species. A landscape approach for the restoration and reclamation of degraded land
                        will ensure
                        sustainable and equitable land use while strengthening measures to mitigate and adapt to
                        climate change.
