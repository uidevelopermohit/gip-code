                                    The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) entered into force on 29 December 1993. CBD was inspired by the world community's growing commitment to sustainable development. It represents a dramatic step forward in the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. The objectives of this Convention, to be pursued in accordance with its relevant provisions, are the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources, including by appropriate access to genetic resources and by appropriate transfer of relevant technologies, taking into account all rights over those resources and to technologies, and by appropriate funding. The main three objectives of CBD are: <br>
                                        1.	The conservation of biological diversity<br>
                                        2.	The sustainable use of the components of biological diversity<br>
                                        3.	The fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources<br>

                                </p>

                                <p>In November 2020, at the Riyadh (Virtual) Summit of the G20 leaders, the G20 launched the Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of Terrestrial Habitats. The ambition of this Global Initiative is to prevent, halt and reverse land degradation and reduce degraded land by 50 per cent by 2040.</p>
                                
                                <h5>Objectives</h5>
                                <p>1.Conserving land and halting habitat loss, fragmentation and land degradation, notably through sharing knowledge and best practices on conservation incentives and implementation of other policies and best practices to enhance land conservation and reduce land degradation.</p>
                                <p>2.Promoting integrated, sustainable, and resilient land and landscape management through: nature-based solutions or ecosystem-based approaches, as well as supporting sustainable land and water management policies and sustainable agricultural practices, including traditional practices, in order to maintain and enhance ecosystem functionality.</p>
                                <p>3.Restoring degraded land through sustainable and locally or regionally appropriate reforestation, afforestation, natural regeneration/revegetation, restoration of ecosystem services, sustainable agricultural practices, and deployment of nature-based solutions or ecosystem-based approaches for biodiversity conservation, among others, in order to restore ecosystem functionality in a landscape context.</p>
                                <h5>Activities</h5>
                                <p>• Land conservation, sustainable management, and restoration website: the initiative will establish a website that will serve as an information sharing hub to provide easier access to information on land degradation, conservation, sustainable management, and restoration and foster collaboration and broader engagement of various stakeholders in land conservation and restoration efforts.</p>
                                <p>• Engagement of private sector and civil society: the Initiative will engage the private sector to encourage it to support land restoration efforts and adopt sustainable land management practices. Similarly, with strong calls from society for urgent environmental action, the Initiative will encourage direct engagement of civil society, including by mobilizing the general public.</p>
                                <p>• Sharing knowledge and building capacity: the initiative will support the exchange of know-how and capacity building between G20 members, non-member countries, and other partners and additional stakeholders, as well as support efforts to accelerate exchange of best practices to enhance land conservation and restoration efforts.</p>
                                
                               

                                <h5>3.Global Biodiversity Framework Fund (GBFF)</h5>
                                <p>
                                    The GEF is a family of funds dedicated to confronting biodiversity loss, climate change, pollution, and strains on land and ocean health. Its grants, blended financing, and policy support helps developing countries address their biggest environmental priorities and adhere to international environmental conventions. Over the past three decades, the GEF has provided more than $23 billion and mobilized $129 billion in co-financing for more than 5,000 national and regional projects.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                At the Global Environment Facility's Seventh Assembly in Canada, representatives from 186 countries introduced a new fund aimed at biodiversity conservation and sustainability. The Global Biodiversity Framework Fund (GBFF) seeks to mobilize investment in the preservation of wild species and ecosystems threatened by factors like wildfires, flooding, extreme weather, and human activity such as urban development.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Canada and the United Kingdom pledged initial contributions to start the fund's capitalization, with Canada providing 200 million Canadian dollars and the UK contributing 10 million pounds. The fund's launch comes during a challenging period marked by record wildfire and hurricane seasons, highlighting the urgency of addressing environmental issues.
                                </p>
                                <p>The GBFF's ratification followed the historic agreement on global biodiversity goals known as the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. It aims to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 and put nature on a path to recovery by 2050. The fund will receive contributions from public, private, and philanthropic sources, with a focus on biodiversity and ecosystem sustainability. It will also allocate resources to support Indigenous-led initiatives and prioritize assistance to Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries.</p>
                                <p>The fund's launch demonstrates global commitment to addressing biodiversity loss and implementing crucial environmental initiatives, as countries work together to protect the planet's natural diversity and ensure a sustainable future.</p>
                                
                              
                                

                                <h5>4.The Paris agreement</h5>
                                <p>
                                    The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, France, on 12 December 2015. It entered into force on 4 November 2016. Its overarching goal is to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.” However, in recent years, world leaders have stressed the need to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of this century. That’s because the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that crossing the 1.5°C threshold risks unleashing far more severe climate change impacts, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall. To limit global warming to 1.5°C, greenhouse gas emissions must peak before 2025 at the latest and decline 43% by 2030. The Paris Agreement is a landmark in the multilateral climate change process because, for the first time, a binding agreement brings all nations together to combat climate change and adapt to its effects.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Implementation of the Paris Agreement requires economic and social transformation, based on the best available science. The Paris Agreement works on a five-year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action -- or, ratcheting up -- carried out by countries. Since 2020, countries have been submitting their national climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Each successive NDC is meant to reflect an increasingly higher degree of ambition compared to the previous version.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Recognizing that accelerated action is required to limit global warming to 1.5°C, the COP27 cover decision requests Parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their NDCs to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2023, taking into account different national circumstances.
                                </p>

                                    IBSA is a unique Forum which brings together India, Brazil and South Africa, three large democracies and major economies from three different continents, facing similar challenges. All three countries are developing, pluralistic, multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and multi-religious nations. The grouping was formalized and named the IBSA Dialogue Forum when the Foreign Ministers of the three countries met in Brasilia on 6 June 2003 and issued the Brasilia Declaration. India is current IBSA Chair. Five IBSA Leadership Summits have been held so far. The 5th IBSA Summit was held in Pretoria on 18 October 2011. India was the IBSA Chair under the theme “Democracy for Demography and Development” in 2021. 
                                    Brazil assumed on March 2, 2023, the rotating presidency of the India, Brazil, South Africa Dialogue Forum - IBSA. Comprising three democratic, multiethnic and multicultural countries, the grouping completes 20 years in 2023. The Brazilian Presidency will seek to strengthen IBSA in its three pillars: political coordination, trilateral cooperation and cooperation with other developing countries, through the IBSA Fund.

                                    Cooperation in IBSA is on three fronts: first, as a forum for consultation and coordination on global and regional political issues, such as, the reform of the global institutions of political and economic governance, WTO/Doha Development Agenda, climate change, terrorism etc.; second, trilateral collaboration on concrete areas/projects, through fourteen working groups and six People-to-People Forums, for the common benefit of three countries; and third, assisting other developing countries by taking up projects in the latter through IBSA Fund. IBSA’s success demonstrates, most vividly, the desirability and feasibility of South-South cooperation beyond the conventional areas of exchange of experts and training.
