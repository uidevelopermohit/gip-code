                                After Forest conservation Act 1980 nearly 1.50 was diverted for mining alone. Other areas for which forest lands were diverted include transmission lines, hydro projects, defence and roads etc. All these areas including mine dumps need restoration and rehabilitation treatments. Mining for minerals and coal certainly destroy the eco system but it is an inevitable as a part of civilization. The increasing human need for mineral and metal resources will affect further degradation of natural habitats, as most of the mining areas are previously forests. Moreover, ecological problems found at mining sites where pose health hazards to nearby residents causing high incidence of asthma, silicosis and stomach ailments due to the mining dust and contamination of water. Mining also has led to discharge of millions of tons of waste rock called mine spoils which are dumped over millions of hectares as wastelands. Rehabilitation of these mine spoils is very essential to overcome the health hazards as well as ecological problems. But rehabilitation of mine spoils has been difficult because it has low water â€“ holding capacity, lacks organic matter and deficient in major nutrients Nitrogen and Phosphorus. The rehabilitation of ecological restoration is the only answer for ensuring sustainable green development of mining areas and thus rehabilitation, reclamation and restoration are all continuum process to bring out the pre - disturbance stage of eco system. Further, once the degraded eco system is restored the economic value of the restored area will increase in terms of ground water, chemical alternation of pollution and fixation of CO2 and species survival (Harris and Diggelen, 2006). There are many success stores and models in the country where degraded sites have been fully restored with technical soil in puts and sites kept out of anthropocentric influences. Hence, restoration of degraded forests like mine spoils is essential for environment and livelihood.

                                            In tropical countries coal is deposited underneath the forests (Bebbingtona et al., 2018). The coal mining activities severely disturb the land by removing vegetation; alter the topography, consequent dumping of subsoil also caused loss of biodiversity of the area (Haigh, 1992; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013). Natural invasion of plant species in such are difficult and also takes time (Hazarika et al., 2006). Moreover, revegetation of such area does not succeed through normal plantation techniques (Skousen and Zipper, 2010).  The study illustrated the advantages of the plantation technology as it does not require topsoil application and application of chemical fertilizers on the plantation site.

                                            The study demonstrated the seedling survival rate of plant species between 60% to 70%. The study also provided an alternative which suggests that 5 kg natural forest topsoil and 2 kg FYM may be applied in each plantation pit at the time of plantation of seedlings raised in 5 kg poly bags without inoculating with AMF and The plantation programme in post coalmine sites can be undertaken with the best treatment combination obtained from this study i.e., planting nursery raised seedlings (1:1 ratio of soil and FYM media filled in 5kg polybags) inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and application of lime @ 15 gm per pit and farm yard manure (FYM) @ 2 kg per pit at the time of planting.

                                            Mineral resource extraction causes enormous soil damage, altering microbial ecosystems and impacting plants, ultimately destroying vast swaths of land. Reclamation is a process of rehabilitating degraded mining land sites to restore their ecological integrity. It encompasses the management of all physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils, such as pH, fertility, microbial community composition, and various soil nutrient cycles, that contribute to the productiveness of degraded land soils. Physical disruption to topsoil during stripping, stockpiling, and reinstatement results in substantial nutrient transformations and movements, resulting in the loss of large amounts of nutrients (Singh and Seema, 2017). Revegetation is by far the most widely accepted and effective method of preventing erosion and protecting soils from degradation during reclamation (Singh et al., 2015). Surface coal mining inevitably deforests land, reduces carbon (C) pool and generates different land covers. Degraded mine soils can act as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide, as SOC is fundamental for various soil processes. SOC contributes towards nutrients and energy for soil microbes and plays a pivotal role in nutrient cycling. With an increase in the year of vegetation restoration, trees help sequester more atmospheric CO2 generating a self-sustaining ecosystem in forested mine soils. Organic matter functions in the soil to improve its physical, chemical, and biological properties and is essential; hence a critical level must be present to improve soil functioning. However, not all tree species have equal potential for soil carbon sequestration. Individual plant species can affect ecosystem processes and influence nutrient dynamics and carbon sequestration by various mechanisms. Organic carbon sequestration depends upon the quality, quantity of litter, and rate of decomposition. Therefore, the choice of plantation species is likely to influence both the rate and the trajectory of carbon sequestration.

                                            <STRONG>d. Carbon Regulating Services of A 30-year-old Reclaimed Limestone Mine Area in Foothills of Himalaya (The Indian Forester, International Journal)</STRONG></br>
                                            The study aimed to assess various carbon regulating services of a limestone mine site, reclaimed 30 years back, compared to its adjoining natural forest. The natural forest is dominated by broad leaf species (Quercus leucotricophora) whereas, the reclaimed sites have Cupressus torulosa as the dominant species. Though there was no significant difference in the number of species of various life forms (trees, shrubs, herbs and grasses), total basal cover (TBC) estimated for the natural forest (2513.36cm /100m) was much higher compared to the reclaimed site (584.30 to 997.07cm /100m). The difference is much higher in TBC of trees compared to shrubs. Annual litter production was also higher in the natural forest. Microbial activity in the topsoil layer was found to have increased substantially in the reclaimed mine site. Soil respiration rate and soil microbial biomass in the reclaimed mine site was on a par with that of natural forest. It indicates a significant level of organic matter and detritus availability in the reclaimed sites' topsoils since the soil's degradable organic carbon is the main fuel responsible for the CO emission during soil 2 respiration. Though the carbon assimilation rate recorded in the vegetation of the reclaimed area is on a par with that of vegetation of natural forest at the species level, at the community level, the reclaimed site may have lower assimilation owing to lower TBC. Therefore, the difference in vegetation structure and composition in the reclaimed site compared to the natural forest might significantly impact the overall carbon regulating services in the study area.
