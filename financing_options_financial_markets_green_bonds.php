                            <p>
                                Green bonds are the bonds issued by any sovereign entity, inter-governmental groups or alliances and corporates with the aim that the proceeds of the bonds are utilised for projects classified as environmentally sustainable. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                India started issuing green bonds since 2015. As of February 12, 2020, the outstanding amount of green bonds in India was US$16.3 billion India issued green bonds of about US$8 billion since January 1, 2018, which constituted about 0.7 per cent of all the bonds issued in the Indian financial market. Although the value of green bonds issued in India since 2018 constituted a very small portion of the total bond issuance, India maintained a favourable position compared to several advanced and emerging economies.  Most of the green bonds issued since 2015 had maturities of five years or above, but less than 10 years. However, some issuers such as Yes Bank Ltd. (2015), Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (2017, 2019), Rural Electrification Corporation Limited or REC Ltd. (2017), Power Finance Corporation Ltd. (2017), Indian Railway Finance Corporation Ltd. Around 76 per cent of the green bonds issued in India since 2015 were denominated in US$. In addition to corporate and government, the World Bank has issued green bonds towards several projects in India from time to time. 
                            </p>
                          
                            
                            <p>
                                Based on the Green Bond Impact report (2019) by the World Bank, it is estimated that the outstanding amount of Green Bond proceeds allocated to support the financing of such projects in India is US$640mn, as on June 30, 2019. In sum, green finance in India is still at the nascent stage. Green bonds constituted only 0.7 per cent of all the bonds issued in India since 2018, and bank lending to the non-conventional energy constituted about 7.9 per cent of outstanding bank credit to the power sector, as of March 2020.

                                        There is hardly any government, agencies or major funds which provide direct financing to mining reclamation projects especially for abandoned /orphaned mines prior to the promulgation of rules about Mine Closure Plan in April 2003. However, public sector banks, in addition to private commercial banks and non-banking financial companies, provide debt financing for mining projects including reclamation activities in India.

                                        India has started emphasising on green finance as early as 2007. In December 2007, the Reserve Bank issued a notification on “Corporate Social Responsibility, Sustainable Development and Non-financial Reporting – Role of Banks” and mentions the importance of global warming and climate change in the context of sustainable development.
