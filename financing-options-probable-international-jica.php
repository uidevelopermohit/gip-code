                            <h5>Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)</h5>
                           
                            
                            <p>
                                <b>Mining:</b> In developing countries with substantial natural resource reserves, energy and mining development can produce results in a relatively short time frame compared with development of other industries serving as an engine for economic growth. Mining development also has a tremendous impact on society and the economy through infrastructure and regional development. For the sustainable development of both developing countries and the global economy, it also is extremely important to ensure a stable and sustainable supply of mineral resources from diverse sources by encouraging mining development in many countries. Against this background, there are many countries with large reserves of natural resources that have a strong desire to develop their mining industry.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A transition from the mineral resource exploration stage to the production stage requires large amounts of capital and advanced technology, which in turn calls for the entry of foreign companies into the mining industry in developing countries. However, many developing countries' governments lack knowledge of how to promote the mining industry or manage corporate activities. They have weaknesses in mining policy, legal systems and frameworks, basic geological information, and infrastructure. Political and social risks, security and conflict risks, and growing "resource nationalism," which tries to impose various regulations on ore exports and mining operations, all point to the essential need for developing countries to develop their own human resources and create employment in the industry. Developing countries are also faced with the challenge of how to translate mining development into national development in the wider context of resource management. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Keeping in mind both extending assistance to developing countries for the previously mentioned mining development issues and Japan's need to secure natural resources, JICA provides cooperation that builds a Win-Win relationship with developing countries. Led by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), Japan's government-related institutions have formed a coordinated and structured collaborative system (a one-stop organization for securing overseas mining resources) working with JICA, and Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) and other organizations. Within that system, JICA implements technical cooperation and human resource development that especially targets governments of developing countries. 
                            </p>
                          
                            
                            <p>
                                JICA has two objectives in the mining sector: (1) to improve the investment environment in terms of both software and hardware aspects by, for example, strengthening the administrative capacity of developing countries' governments and developing peripheral infrastructure; and (2) to develop human resources. For the second objective, JICA has recently been working with Japanese universities to offer the training program in Japan, popularly known as the "Kizuna Program." The program is aimed both at allowing the participants to build a human network involving Japanese people and at strengthening relations with resource-endowed countries. Specifically, JICA focuses on four priority areas in the mining sector: 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                (1) Assistance for the development of peripheral infrastructure essential to mining development, such as roads, railways, harbors, electric power, and water supply for development of peripheral utilities. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                (2) Assistance involving government planning and formulating policies for legal systems, policies, implementation systems, and basic information compilation necessary for mining development and appropriate mineral resource management.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                (3) Strengthening governments' administrative skills in soliciting private sector investment and implementing sustainable mining development and resource management. Specifically, JICA provides assistance related to supplying basic information necessary for resource exploration and establishing management systems. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                (4) Developing mining pollution control technologies, in cooperation with Japanese universities, as appropriate, and assist with public administration of mine safety and mining environmental management. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <b>Natural Environment Conservation: </b>JICA aims to support partner countries in their efforts to conserve the natural environment and pursue the sustainable use of natural resources in line with the international environmental frameworks for socio-economic development, and to enable future generations to enjoy various services from the natural environment.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The following two clusters are established in the Global Agenda 'Natural Environment Conservationâ€™: 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                1) Sustainable Natural Resource Management on Land By 2030, the structures of more than 40 central/local government institutions responsible for terrestrial nature conservation will be strengthened and 10,000 administrative officers, etc. will be trained. (Related to SDG 15) 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                2) Sustainable Natural Resource Management in Coastal Areas By 2030, the structures of more than 8 central/local government institutions responsible for coastal nature conservation will be strengthened and 2,000 administrative officers, etc. will be trained. (Related to SDG 14) 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This will contribute to promote the conservation of the natural environment (ecosystems) including biodiversity and the sustainable use of natural resources, and as a result contributing to climate change action (SDG 13) in targeted areas, with the ultimate aim of achieving a sustainable society. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                To address these issues, the current status of the natural environment and the factors underlying its loss and degradation should be analyzed scientifically. Further, policy objectives and targets need to be set from a medium- to long-term perspective, and the measures taken must be based on concrete plans. For this, the capacity for monitoring environmental risks and institutional mechanisms (environmental governance) will have to be strengthened. Further, a collaborative management system among key stakeholders, including local communities, needs to be established. From a financial standpoint, countries must have the capacity to identify the economic and social benefits of the natural environment, ensure policy priorities, and secure the necessary financial resources.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In many partner countries, the lack of national budgets often makes it challenging to allocate sufficient funds to the sector. As such, strategies to make effective use of multilateral funds associated with international environment treaties to complement national efforts become all the more important. Policy capacity, planning capacity, and scientific data are all keys to accessing potential funds.
                            </p>

                                            The Climate Change Action Plan 2021â€“2025 aims to advance the climate change aspects of the WBGâ€™s Green, Resilient, and Inclusive Development (GRID) approach, which pursues poverty eradication and shared prosperity with a sustainability lens. In the Action Plan, we will support countries and private sector clients to maximize the impact of climate finance, aiming for measurable improvements in adaptation and resilience and measurable reductions in GHG emissions.
