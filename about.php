                    The Group of Twenty (G20) was established in 1999 to discuss international economic and financial stability. It comprises 19 countries and the European Union, with the African Union joining as a permanent member. The G20 is the premier forum for international economic cooperation, shaping global governance on major issues. Initially focused on macroeconomics, it has expanded to include trade, sustainable development, health, agriculture, energy, environment, climate change, and anti-corruption.

                    The Group of Twenty (G20) was founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 as an informal forum for the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the most important industrialized and developing economies to discuss international economic and financial stability. The G20 comprises 19 countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Türkiye, United Kingdom, and United States) and European Union. Under the India's G20 Presidency, the African Union joins as a permanent member with all party consensus.  G20 is the premier forum for international economic cooperation, and it plays an important role in shaping and strengthening global architecture and governance on all major international economic issues. The G20 was upgraded to the level of Heads of State/Government in the wake of the global economic and financial crisis of 2007, and, in 2009, was designated the “premier forum for international economic cooperation”. The G20 Summit is held annually, under the leadership of a rotating Presidency. The G20 initially focused largely on broad macroeconomic issues, but it has since expanded its agenda to inter-alia include trade, sustainable development, health, agriculture, energy, environment, climate change, and anti-corruption.

                <h5> History of Gandhinagar Information Platform (GIP)</h5>
                <p>The Ministerial Communique of the G20 Environmental Ministers Meet during the Saudi Arabia Summit 2020 recognised the urgent
                    need for bold, coordinated, and collective initiatives on land protection and restoration and on sustainable land 
                    management and use to strengthen existing efforts, such as the Bonn Challenge, the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem 
                    Restoration, and other multilateral initiatives, as well as to promote new ones. One of the key elements of the initiative 
                    was to establish a land conservation, sustainable management, and restoration website. The Saudi Summit declared to support
                    the launch of a Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of Terrestrial Habitats which
                    aims to support existing efforts to prevent, halt, and reverse land degradation and habitat loss through sharing of 
                    knowledge and best practices on protecting, conserving, sustainably managing, restoring, and rehabilitating degraded 
                    land, and by showcasing and disseminating publicly available data and information on degraded lands and conservation/
                    restoration efforts – Global Restoration Information Hub (GRIH).

                        The G20 Environment communiqué held in Italy 2021 summit stressed that biodiversity conservation, protection, 
                        sustainable use, and restoration are critical to achieve the SDGs and to halt and reverse biodiversity loss.

                        In 2022 the G20 Indonesia Summit pledged to continue to support the G20 Global Initiative on Reducing Land

                        enhance land protection, conservation, and restoration, address common land tenure challenges in accordance with 
                        national legislation in line with the recent decision 27 at UNCCD COP15 and promote inclusive sustainable land

                        Sustainability Working Group (ECSWG). India proposes a knowledge sharing platform- Gandhinagar Information Portal

                    Centre for Excellence under the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) is proposed to have the 
                    responsibility as UNCCD regional hub for design, implementation, and maintenance of GIP for the priority landscape- 
                    mining affected areas. Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM) will be the other regional hub for coordinating, 
                    networking, and articulating inputs for restoration of forest fire affected areas. The two regional institutes 
                    (viz. ICFRE and IIFM) shall act as the focal point for coordinating with the nodal institutes as nominated by the 
                    G20 member countries to collect, collate, and identify suitable technologies which shall be low-cost, regionally
                    conducive, and easily adoptable and replicable globally.
