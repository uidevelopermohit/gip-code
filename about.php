                        The Group of Twenty (G20) was established in 1999 to discuss international economic and
                        financial
                        stability. It comprises 19 countries and the European Union, with the African Union joining as a
                        permanent member. The G20 is the premier forum for international economic cooperation, shaping
                        global governance on major issues. Initially focused on macroeconomics, it has expanded to
                        include
                        trade, sustainable development, health, agriculture, energy, environment, climate change, and
                        anti-corruption.

                    <p>
                        The Group of Twenty (G20) was founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 as an
                        informal forum for the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the most important
                        industrialized and developing economies to discuss international economic and financial
                        stability.
                        The G20 comprises 19 countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany,
                        India,
                        Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Türkiye,
                        United Kingdom, and United States) and European Union. Under the India's G20 Presidency, the
                        African
                        Union joins as a permanent member with all party consensus. G20 is the premier forum for
                        international economic cooperation, and it plays an important role in shaping and strengthening
                        global architecture and governance on all major international economic issues. The G20 was
                        upgraded
                        to the level of Heads of State/Government in the wake of the global economic and financial
                        crisis of
                        2007, and, in 2009, was designated the “premier forum for international economic cooperation”.
                        The
                        G20 Summit is held annually, under the leadership of a rotating Presidency. The G20 initially
                        focused largely on broad macroeconomic issues, but it has since expanded its agenda to
                        inter-alia
                        include trade, sustainable development, health, agriculture, energy, environment, climate
                        change,
                        and anti-corruption.

                    <p>The Ministerial Communique of the G20 Environmental Ministers Meet during the Saudi Arabia Summit
                        2020 recognised the urgent
                        need for bold, coordinated, and collective initiatives on land protection and restoration and on
                        sustainable land
                        management and use to strengthen existing efforts, such as the Bonn Challenge, the United

                        Decade on Ecosystem
                        Restoration, and other multilateral initiatives, as well as to promote new ones. One of the key
                        elements of the initiative
                        was to establish a land conservation, sustainable management, and restoration website. The Saudi
                        Summit declared to support
                        the launch of a Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of
                        Terrestrial Habitats which
                        aims to support existing efforts to prevent, halt, and reverse land degradation and habitat loss
                        through sharing of
                        knowledge and best practices on protecting, conserving, sustainably managing, restoring, and
                        rehabilitating degraded
                        land, and by showcasing and disseminating publicly available data and information on degraded
                        lands
                        and conservation/

                        for coordinating,

                        (viz. ICFRE and IIFM) shall act as the focal point for coordinating with the nodal institutes as
