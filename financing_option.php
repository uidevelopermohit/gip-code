                                            India’s commitment to the preservation of the environment is enshrined in Article 48-A of 
                                            the constitution. Over the years, India has taken steps both at national and sub-national 
                                            levels to balance environmental sustainability with economic growth.

Climate Change is a global phenomenon but with local consequences. Realizing this, the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) was launched in 2008 with eight National Missions.<br>

                                            Through the amendment in Mines & Minerals (Development & Regulation) (MMDR) Act, in 2015, Government of India has made provision for establishment of District Mineral Foundation in all the districts affected by mining. Accordingly, Section 9(B) of the MMDR Act provides for the establishment of DMF as a non-profit body, object of DMF, and the power of State Government to prescribe the composition and functions of District Mineral Foundation. The object of the District Mineral Foundation is to work for the interest and benefit of persons, and areas affected by mining related operations. So far, DMFs have been set up in 626 districts in 23 States in the country which have framed DMF rules.

                                            The Ministry of Mines developed a credible system of evaluation of mining footprints and instituted the Sustainable Development Framework (SDF) for taking up mining activity under its umbrella, encompassing inclusive growth, without adversely affecting the social, economic and environmental well-being, at present and also in future generation. Further, to implement the Sustainable Development Framework (SDF), Ministry has evolved a system of Star Rating of Mines. The Star Rating is being implemented as per the provisions of Rule 35 of Mineral Conservation and Development Rules’2017 through the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM), a subordinate office of the Ministry of Mines.

                                        The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved capital management reforms aimed at unlocking $100 billion in new funding capacity over the next decade to address various crises in the region. These reforms, introduced through an update of ADB's Capital Adequacy Framework, expand the bank's annual new commitments capacity to over $36 billion, an increase of about 40%. The reforms also create a Countercyclical Lending Buffer to support ADB's developing member countries (DMCs) facing unexpected crises.

                                            Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has emerged as a vital source of funding for initiatives related to land degradation, environmental conservation, and ecological restoration in India. The Companies Act, 2013, mandates that companies meeting certain financial thresholds allocate at least 2% of their profits to CSR activities. These contributions have a significant impact on environmental projects. CSR funding has been directed toward projects that tackle land degradation and ecological restoration.

In FY 2022, private contributions totalled about $13 billion (INR 1.05 lakh crore). Corporate social responsibility (CSR), family philanthropy, and retail giving cumulatively contributed about 86% of private philanthropy in India and are expected to remain the foundation of private giving in India.

                                            Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has emerged as a vital source of funding for initiatives related to land degradation, environmental conservation, and ecological restoration in India. The Companies Act, 2013, mandates that companies meeting certain financial thresholds allocate at least 2% of their profits to CSR activities. These contributions have a significant impact on environmental projects. CSR funding has been directed toward projects that tackle land degradation and ecological restoration.

In FY 2022, private contributions totalled about $13 billion (INR 1.05 lakh crore). Corporate social responsibility (CSR), family philanthropy, and retail giving cumulatively contributed about 86% of private philanthropy in India and are expected to remain the foundation of private giving in India.
