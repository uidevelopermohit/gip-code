                    <p>
                        <strong>First Environment and Climate Sustainability Working Group (ECSWG) meeting concluded in Bengaluru with all G20 
                        countries showing commitment to constructively work towards the objective of the three priority areas</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The First G20 Environment and Climate Sustainability Working Group (ECSWG) meeting concluded in Bengaluru on a 
                        positive note with all G20 countries showing interest and commitment to constructively work towards the 
                        objective of the three priority areas of Arresting Land Degradation, Accelerating Ecosystem Restoration and 
                        Enriching Biodiversity, Promoting a Sustainable and Climate Resilient Blue Economy and Encouraging Resource 
                        Efficiency and Circular Economy. The first meeting of Environment and Climate Sustainability Working Group 
                        (ECSWG) marked the beginning of constructive discussions within G20 countries for a sustainable future, led 
                        by India’s G20 presidency. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The Presidency presented the inception report of the technical study on ‘Accelerating the transition to 
                         Sustainable & Climate Resilient Blue Economy’ that would cover all G20 Countries and provide inputs for 
                         development of high-level principles on ‘Sustainable and Climate Resilient Blue Economy’. It was also 
                         mentioned that Indian Presidency will publish the 5th report on actions against marine plastic litter 
                         under the G20 Framework for Marine Plastic Litter, in collaboration with Japan. Delegates expressed 
                         support for actions for sustainable use of ocean resources, prevention of pollution and littering 
                         and for protection and enhancement of biodiversity. These are critical for building resilience to climate 
                         impacts and maintain the carbon sequestration potential of oceans, besides contributing to a thriving blue 
                         economy that would support livelihoods of local coastal communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Towards the concluding session, it was highlighted that the India Presidency plans to convene an Ocean 20 
                        dialogue to facilitate detailed discussion on important aspects on Blue Economy. The Indian Presidency also 
                        announced a coordinated beach cleaning event to be conducted on 21st of May 2023 on the sidelines of the Ocean 
                        20 dialogue to emphasize on the importance of action on marine litter and community participation. The 
                        importance of LiFE (Lifestyles for Environment) Principles was highlighted, as behaviour changes to encourage 
                        use of sustainable alternatives to single use plastics, prevention of littering etc.  would contribute to 
                        clean and healthy oceans.
