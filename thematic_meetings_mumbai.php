                        The 3rd Environment and Climate Sustainability Working Group (ECSWG) meeting was held in Mumbai from May 21-23, 
                        2023. The main focus of this meeting was on steering the discussions around Communique with a more outcome 
                        driven approach. To ensure continuity and build on the initiative, the Indian Presidency is demonstrating 
                        active leadership by anchoring the Ocean 20 Dialogue in the 3rd ECSWG which will focus on three significant 
                        pillars of the Blue Economy. Both the side events are aimed at promoting a sustainable and climate resilient 
                        Blue Economy.

                         The Environment and Climate Sustainability Group (ECSWG) under Indiaâ€™s G20 Presidency aims to enhance 
                         cooperation among the G20 nations to develop state of the art solutions for sustainable management of 
                         oceans and marine biodiversity conservation. The need for concerted global efforts and immediate action to 
                         address the current scenario has been consistently underscored in the meetings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third ECSWG meeting was a critical step in fostering the efforts of the G20 countries, invitee countries, 
                        and international organizations towards a sustainable and resilient future. The Ministry of Environment, Forest 
                        and Climate Change is committed to working with all stakeholders to drive outcomes under each of the priority
