                                        There is hardly any government, agencies or major funds which provide direct financing to mining reclamation projects especially for abandoned /orphaned mines prior to the promulgation of rules about Mine Closure Plan in April 2003. However, public sector banks, in addition to private commercial banks and non-banking financial companies, provide debt financing for mining projects including reclamation activities in India.
