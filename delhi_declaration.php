                    the
                    Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework
                    (GBF), and encourage others to do the same, and encourage actions to halt and reverse

                    the
                    recent
                    establishment of the Global Biodiversity Framework Fund within the Global Environment Facility

                <li>Support the G20 ambition to reduce land degradation by 50%
                    by
                    2040 on a voluntary basis, as committed under the
                    G20 Global Land Initiative (GLI) and note the discussions on the Gandhinagar Implementation
                    Roadmap
                    and the
                    Gandhinagar Information Platform.</li>
                <li>Recognize that forests provide crucial ecosystem services,
                    as
                    well as for climate purposes acting as sinks, at
                    the global and local levels for the environment, climate and people. We will scale up efforts to
                    protect,
                    conserve and sustainably manage forests and combat deforestation, in line with internationally
                    agreed
                    timelines, highlighting the contributions of these actions for sustainable development and
                    taking
                    into account
                    the social and economic challenges of local communities and indigenous peoples. In the context
                    of
                    forests, we
                    will avoid discriminatory green economic policies, consistent with WTO rules and multilateral
                    environmental
                    agreements. We are committed to mobilizing new and additional finance for forests from all
                    sources,
                    including
                    concessional and innovative financing, in particular for developing countries. We commit to
                    prevention and
                    mitigation of wildfires and remediation of mining-degraded lands.</li>
                <li>Call for enhancing global cooperation and sharing of best
                    practices on water and welcome the deliberations at
