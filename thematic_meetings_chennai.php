                        The success of the G20 Environment and Climate Sustainability Working Group's endeavours stands as a testimony 
                        to the collective will and determination of the G20 nations to tackle environmental challenges head-on. As the 
                        India Presidency's term draws to a close, the legacy of this fruitful collaboration will continue to inspire
