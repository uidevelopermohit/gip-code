                                Private philanthropy has grown at a moderate pace of about 8% from FY 2017 through FY 2022, despite foreign funding remaining stagnant. In FY 2022, private contributions totalled about $13 billion (INR 1.05 lakh crore). Corporate social responsibility (CSR), family philanthropy, and retail giving cumulatively contributed about 86% of private philanthropy in India and are expected to remain the foundation of private giving in India. India is home to several philanthropic foundations and organizations that play a crucial role in supporting initiatives related to land degradation, environmental conservation, and ecological restoration. Prominent philanthropic foundations in India, such as the Tata Trusts, Azim Premji Foundation, and Adani Foundation, are making substantial contributions to environmental projects.   The philanthropic fundingsâ€™ major areas of focus include land conservation, water resource management, wildlife protection, and reforestation projects. The diverse nature of the contributions ensures a holistic approach to environmental restoration. Philanthropic foundations often engage local communities in their initiatives, encouraging participation and ownership of environmental projects. This community-centered approach enhances the effectiveness and sustainability of conservation and restoration efforts. Some foundations allocate resources to research and development projects that explore innovative solutions for land degradation and ecological restoration. These initiatives contribute to the development of sustainable practices and technologies.

                                Family philanthropy has grown at 12% over the last five years, reaching $3.6 billion (INR 29,600 crore) in FY 2022. Retail giving in India continues to be community-driven with just over 22% of contribution value coming from formal giving. It has grown at a modest 6% annually from FY 2017 to FY 2022, with contributions reaching $4 billion (INR 32,700 crore). However, with the expanding middle class and the sheer growth in the number of donors, retail giving is expected to grow at 9% annually and contribute about 29% of total private giving by FY 2027.

                                        Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has emerged as a vital source of funding for initiatives related to land degradation, environmental conservation, and ecological restoration in India. The Companies Act, 2013, mandates that companies meeting certain financial thresholds allocate at least 2% of their profits to CSR activities. These contributions have a significant impact on environmental projects. CSR funding has been directed toward projects that tackle land degradation and ecological restoration.
