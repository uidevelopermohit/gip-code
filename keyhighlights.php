                            <p>
                                We stress that ecosystems including, but not limited to, forests, grasslands, drylands, rangelands, 
                                croplands, peatlands, mangroves, soil, tundra, karst, and wetlands are essential for the existence, 
                                survival and sustainability of biodiversity as well as food security and human well-being and are an 
                                example of natural capital. We emphasize that healthy ecosystems provide vital provisioning and 
                                regulating services including maintaining air quality and freshwater resources, supplying food, 
                                medicinal products, wood and fiber, mitigating pollutants, supporting human health and well-being 
                                as well as nature-based recreation. In addition, healthy ecosystems play an important role in absorbing 
                                emissions and in reducing the risk of natural disasters and adapting to extreme weather events as well 
                                as in limiting land degradation, including by combating desertification and mitigating against future 
                                diseases and pandemics. In this sense, it is important to promote public programs and policies for the 
                                development of payment for ecosystem services taking into account the economic valuation of ecosystems 
                                and their services to inform decision-making as well as develop public private partnerships and provide 
                                incentives for private sector and stakeholder engagement and for the creation of a functional market 
                                for such services. We also acknowledge that land degradation in all its forms is a key force 
                                exacerbating biodiversity loss by driving fragmentation and loss of terrestrial habitats. Moreover, 
                                land degradation threatens a significant and increasing number of habitats and species around the 
                                world.

                                We recognize the urgent need for bold, coordinated, and collective initiatives on land protection and 
                                restoration and on sustainable land management and use to strengthen existing efforts, such as the Bonn 
                                Challenge, the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, and other multilateral initiatives, as 
                                well as to promote new ones. We recognize the benefits of cooperation between neighboring countries 
                                in sustainable land and water management and ecological conservation and restoration. We acknowledge 
                                the benefits of sustainable agriculture as an approach that adopts methods and practices that pursue 
                                productive, sustainable, and resilient food production systems that minimize harmful impacts to the 
                                environment, biodiversity and food security across the system – for the current generation and the 
                                generations after. We further acknowledge the benefits of the existing efforts and commitments such as 
                                those developed for Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), Forest Landscape Restoration, Ecosystem-based 
                                Adaptation, and Disaster Risk Reduction as well as targets under the Convention of Biological Diversity 
                                and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. We also recognize the contributions made 
                                through actions taken to meet the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. We call for increased efforts and 
                                cooperation to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality as set out in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3 
                                target, as well as to scale-up successful and appropriate action that will contribute to LDN without 
                                hampering the achievement of other SDGs. In the context of the economic recovery from COVID-19 and the 
                                associated challenges faced by our food systems and supply chains, work towards promoting sustainable 
                                value chains, delivering nature-based solutions or ecosystem-based approaches, and implementing 
                                sustainable land use measures and secure land tenure with gender responsiveness will yield direct 
                                benefits to the livelihoods of rural and indigenous communities. We encourage public and private 
                                engagement to mobilize finance and investment for effective implementation of such vital measures 
                                to maximize the potential opportunity provided by these.

                                We stress the importance of science- and evidence-based approaches to policy making and take note of 
                                the findings of the international and regional bodies spearheading robust research and assessment 
                                activities. We also acknowledge the role of the traditional knowledge of Indigenous Peoples and local 
                                communities. We support research and development, harnessing science, technology and innovation, and 
                                leveraging technologies towards implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as well as 
                                other related development initiatives. We note with deep concern the findings presented in recent 
                                scientific assessments, which reflect the best available science and highlight the fact that 
                                unprecedented exploitation of land and freshwater resources are implying higher risks to people’s 
                                livelihoods and well-being, and that biodiversity is declining globally at a rate unprecedented in 
                                human history, in particular due to unsustainable use of natural resources and land degradation. We 
                                also note the think-piece by the International Resource Panel on ‘Land Restoration for Achieving the 
                                Sustainable Development Goals’ according to which land restoration and rehabilitation can have 
                                significant co-benefits for all the SDGs. In the context of the evidence above, we underscore the 
                                importance of continuing work at all levels to achieve the inter-linked objectives of the United 
                                Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the three Rio Conventions and the Global Forest Goals of 
                                the United Nations Strategic Plan for Forests, guided by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
                                We are committed to combating land degradation and habitat loss in the framework of SDG 15 and the 
                                United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, and to stepping up our efforts on the conservation 
                                and sustainable management of land and biodiversity in advance of the fifteenth meeting of the 
                                Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the CBD, the fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties 
                                (COP 15) of the UNCCD and throughout the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. We call for 
                                all CBD parties to adopt at CBD COP 15 an ambitious, realistic, practical, and effective Post-2020 
                                Global Biodiversity Framework with strong implementation support mechanisms, responsibility and 
                                transparency, including enhanced reporting, to facilitate the transformational changes needed to 
                                achieve the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity.

                                We support the launch of a Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation 
                                of Terrestrial Habitats which aims to support existing efforts to prevent, halt, and reverse land 
                                degradation and habitat loss through sharing of knowledge and best practices on protecting, conserving, 
                                sustainably managing, restoring, and rehabilitating degraded land, and by showcasing and disseminating 
                                publicly available data and information on degraded lands and conservation/restoration efforts. The 
                                initiative will also contribute to capacity building and encourage greater private sector support and 
                                general public engagement in land restoration efforts. The initiative focuses on complementing and 
                                supporting existing efforts while striving to avoid any duplication of efforts. The Initiative will 
                                seek synergies with existing relevant initiatives including the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and 
                                the implementation of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.

                                on a voluntary basis, and will strive to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality by 2030. We will build on 
                                the G20 Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of Terrestrial 
                                Habitats launched under Saudi Presidency and look forward to its upcoming Implementation Strategy. 
                                We recognize the efforts made by a number of countries to adhere to the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature and 
                                to ensure that at least 30 % of global land and at least 30 % of the global ocean and seas are 
                                conserved or protected by 2030, and we will help to make progress towards this objective in accordance 
                                with national circumstances. We encourage and support others to make similarly ambitious commitments. 
                                We will pursue our efforts to ensure the conservation, protection and sustainable use of natural 
                                resources and will take concrete measures to end overfishing, deliver on our commitment to end illegal,

                                the planet, and urge other countries to join forces with the G20 to reach this global goal by 2030, 
                                including through climate projects, with the involvement of the private sector and civil society.

                                We welcome the successful convening of the workshop organized by the Italian Presidency on the G20 
                                Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of Terrestrial Habitats 
                                launched under Saudi Arabia’s Presidency in 2020. We reiterate our support for the Initiative and 
                                on a voluntary basis, will continue to lead, strengthen cooperation, further promote investment and 
                                provide adequate means of implementation and share experiences on land protection, conservation, 
                                sustainable management and restoration initiatives and programs in line with the objectives of the 
                                Initiative.

                                We stress that the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration is a crucial window of opportunity to protect, 
                                conserve, restore and sustainably manage land, including forest, and water resources. Building on 
                                existing initiatives we share the ambition to achieve a 50% reduction of degraded land by 2040, on a 
                                voluntary basis. We will continue our efforts to combat desertification, restore degraded land and 
                                soil, and strive to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality by 2030 in furtherance of SDG Target 15.3 
                                and a number of related Sustainable Development Goals and Targets. We encourage the integration of 
                                land conservation, restoration and sustainable management into post COVID19 recovery plans and 
                                strategies. We emphasize that healthy ecosystems, inter alia, forests, grasslands, drylands, 
                                rangelands, croplands, peatlands, mangroves, soil, tundra, karst, and wetlands are essential 
                                for the sustainability of biodiversity, food security and supporting human health and well-being. 
                                This underscores the importance of terrestrial ecosystems and the services they provide including 
                                for both global food security and resilience to future shocks. In this context, we welcome the G20 
                                Matera Declaration on Food Security, Nutrition and Food Systems, contributing as appropriate to 
                                working with relevant Ministers towards the UN Food Systems Summit. We support voluntary global and 
                                national efforts to protect and conserve land and ecosystems in accordance with national priorities 
                                and policies. We aim to coordinate our actions with ongoing multilateral efforts for the protection 
                                conservation, sustainable management and restoration of degraded terrestrial ecosystems and habitats.

                                We welcome the progress to date towards achieving a Post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). 
                                We urge all parties and countries to finalize and adopt the GBF with the view of realizing of 2050 
                                Vision of “Living in harmony with Nature” at the second part of COP15 CBD as a strong framework of 
                                action and accountability for halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030 and, as appropriate, 
                                to update National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans accordingly. We emphasize the importance 
                                of achieving and synergizing the objectives of the three Rio Conventions. We stress the need for clear 
                                and measurable goals and targets for biodiversity and means of implementation and accountability. We 
                                commit to strengthen actions to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 and call on CBD Parties to 
                                adopt an ambitious, balanced, practical, effective, robust and transformative post-2020 Global 
                                Biodiversity Framework at COP-15 in Montreal. We urge for increased resource mobilization from 
                                all sources, including from countries and entities, to provide new and additional financial 
                                resources for the implementation of the GBF, once it is negotiated, including to help enable and 
                                support developing country parties, and for aligning private and public financial flows with 
                                biodiversity objectives. We will scale up efforts to combat biodiversity loss, deforestation, 
                                desertification, land degradation and drought, as well as restoring degraded land to achieve 
                                land degradation neutrality by 2030, and in support of the G20’s ambition to reduce land degradation 
                                by 50% by 2040 on a voluntary basis. We recognize the effort made by a number of countries to ensure 
                                that at least 30% of global land and at least 30% of the global ocean and seas are conserved or 
                                protected by 2030 and we will help to make progress towards this objective in accordance with 
                                national circumstances. We commit to reduce environmental impacts by changing unsustainable 
                                consumption and production patterns as well as to enhance environmentally sound waste management 
                                including by preventing illegal cross-border traffic of waste.
