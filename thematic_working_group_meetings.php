                    The First G20 Environment and Climate Sustainability Working Group (ECSWG) meeting concluded in Bengaluru on a positive 
                    note with all G20 countries showing interest and commitment to constructively work towards the objective of the three 
                    priority areas of Arresting Land Degradation, Accelerating Ecosystem Restoration and Enriching Biodiversity, Promoting 
                    a Sustainable and Climate Resilient Blue Economy and Encouraging Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy. The first 
                    meeting of Environment and Climate Sustainability Working Group (ECSWG) marked the beginning of constructive 
                    discussions within G20 countries for a sustainable future, led by India’s G20 presidency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Presidency presented the inception report of the technical study on ‘Accelerating the transition to Sustainable & 
                    Climate Resilient Blue Economy’ that would cover all G20 Countries and provide inputs for development of high-level 
                    principles on ‘Sustainable and Climate Resilient Blue Economy’. It was also mentioned that Indian Presidency will 
                    publish the 5th report on actions against marine plastic litter under the G20 Framework for Marine Plastic Litter, 
                    in collaboration with Japan. Delegates expressed support for actions for sustainable use of ocean resources, prevention 
                    of pollution and littering and for protection and enhancement of biodiversity. These are critical for building 
                    resilience to climate impacts and maintain the carbon sequestration potential of oceans, besides contributing to 
                    a thriving blue economy that would support livelihoods of local coastal communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Towards the concluding session, it was highlighted that the India Presidency plans to convene an Ocean 20 dialogue to 
                    facilitate detailed discussion on important aspects on Blue Economy. The Indian Presidency also announced a coordinated 
                    beach cleaning event to be conducted on 21st of May 2023 on the sidelines of the Ocean 20 dialogue to emphasize on the 
                    importance of action on marine litter and community participation. The importance of LiFE (Lifestyles for Environment) 
                    Principles was highlighted, as behaviour changes to encourage use of sustainable alternatives to single use plastics, 
                    prevention of littering etc. would contribute to clean and healthy oceans.
