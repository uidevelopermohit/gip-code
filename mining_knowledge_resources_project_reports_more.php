                                Almost all the mining techniques from mineral explorations to production and transport are causing environmental damage in several ways. The list includes deforestation, loss of topsoil, accelerated soil erosion, soil contamination, qualitative and quantitative depletion of surface and ground water resources, migration of wildlife and avian fauna, and addition of air pollutants and dust in the atmosphere. Land degradation, disruption in the goods and services offered by the nature and forest has been compromised greatly. In lieu of this, to reverse the degradation of environment in Dhanbad coalfield, a model plantation/ecological restoration was carried with the objectives i) To stabilize overburden dumps to control erosion; ii) To conserve and enhance the biodiversity of mined out areas; iii) To generate natural resources to cater the needs of local people and iv) To develop aesthetic view of mined out area. Based on the condition of area, different ecological restoration approaches were applied during project period of three years (2011- 2014). A total of 13,000 plants of different species including horticulture species have been planted in the project site.

                                The various activities required for ecological restoration of coal mines have been discussed and suggested for their implementation in the field as the part of road map. These activities included the management of waste dumps through application of engineering measures such as toe/retention walls, garland drains, geo-textile/coir mat/jute mat, and measures for the surface water management such as gabion check dam, loose boulder check dam, stone masonry check dam, log wood check dam, brush wood check dam, silt settling tank, etc., and techniques for soil and moisture conservation (i.e., mulching, top soil spreading, raising grasses, etc.). As a part of biological measures this included selection of species, methods of planting (Direct seed sowing, seed mix soil ball/slurry, hydro seeding, seedling planting), etc. Measures for the management of backfilled OB dump, haul and approach roads have also been suggested in road map. Native species suitable for avenue plantation and wastelands, green belt development, socioeconomic development and livelyhood opportunities have been suggested. Suitable leguminous and grass species for use in restoration are also suggested separately.</p>

                                Ecological restoration has the potential to reverse the land degradation, increase the resilience of biodiversity, and deliver important ecosystem services that facilitate the recovery of structural and functional components of ecosystem, which have been destroyed or degraded by mining activities. Coal is a most important and abundant fossil fuel having a proven reserve of 860 billion tones, out of which 55% of it is being utilized in meeting country’s energy demand. The power sector followed by iron, steel, and cement segments are the largest consumer of coal in India. Thus, it becomes inevitable for continuous mining of coal. Coal mining whether it is done by strip mining (open cast mining) or underground mining, are equally responsible for environmental degradation.  </p>
                                <p>Ecological restoration followed by enhancement of biodiversity in the ecologically restored site was carried out in 8ha coal mined OB dumps at tetulmari, Sijua area of BCCL, Dhanbad. Nearly 6060 plant of different species of multiple uses were planted by various means such as sowing, seedling, planting, stem cutting at the site. Out of them, there were 24 tree species, 2 shrubs, 2 grasses and 1 bamboo species. Species planted at the site were assessed for their growth. Soil samples from the site were collected and analysed for their physio-chemical properties. Vegetation analysis in 2016 and 2017 was carried out using quadrat sampling method. The quadrats size were 5m X 5m and 1m X 1m respectively to record trees, shrubs, saplings and herbaceous layer. </p>
