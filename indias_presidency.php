                        but
                        contribute to the broader global well-being, reinforcing its spirit of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’
                        or
                        the

                        The G20 Logo draws inspiration from the vibrant colours of India’s national flag – saffron,
                        white
                        and
                        green, and blue. It juxtaposes planet Earth with the lotus, India’s national flower that
                        reflects
                        growth
                        amid challenges. The Earth reflects India’s pro-planet approach to life, one in perfect harmony
                        with
                        nature.
                        Below the G20 logo is “Bharat”, written in the Devanagari script. The theme of India’– G20
                        Presidency -
                        “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” or “One Earth · One Fami–y · One Future” - is drawn from the ancient
                        Sanskrit text
                        of the Maha Upanishad. Essentially, the theme affirms the value of all life – human, animal,
                        plant,
                        and
                        microorganisms – and their interconnectedness on the planet Earth and in the wider universe.

                        The logo and the theme together convey a powerful message of India’s G20 Presidency, which is of
                        striving for
                        just and equitable growth for all in the world, as we navigate through these turbulent times, in
                        a
                        sustainable,
                        holistic, responsible, and inclusive manner. They represent a uniquely Indian approach to our

                        For India, the G20 Presidency also marks the beginning of “Amritkaal”, the 25-year period
                        beginning
                        from the

                        other key
                        issues. The discussions have covered financing mechanisms and frontier technologies to promote

                            Indonesia chose “Recover Together, Recover Stronger” as the overall theme for its
                            Presidency, as
                            a
                            way to advance strong and inclusive global recovery from COVID-19 pandemic. The idea was to
                            reflect
                            the spirit of collective recovery in the world and ensure that G20 projects an inclusive

                            The
                            presidency identified three main pillars: i) Global Health Architecture – Stronger global

                            resilience towards any future pandemic; ii) Digital Transformation – Achieving the true
                            potentials
                            from the rapid digitalization of the global economy to secure common prosperity in the
                            digital
                            age;
                            and iii) Sustainable Energy Transitions – New approaches and dimensions to accelerate the
                            transition
                            towards cleaner energy sources for ensuring a cleaner and brighter future for the global

                            The 15th G20 Summit was held under the theme ‘Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century
                            for
                            all’. It was the first ever virtual Summit in the history of G20. At the initiative of Prime
                            Minister Modi, the Saudi Presidency also convened an ‘Extraordinary Virtual G20 Leaders’
                            Summit on 25 March 2020 to discuss the challenges posed by the outbreak of the COVID-19
                            pandemic and to forge a coordinated global response. Following which the Leaders released
                            a statement on COVID19 expressing commitment to fight the pandemic; safeguarding the global
                            economy; addressing international trade disruptions and enhancing global cooperation to

                            The focus of the Summit in Los Cabos (Mexico) in 2012 was on fighting youth unemployment and
                            creating
                            quality jobs with social security coverage and fair income. The Summit also highlighted the
                            link
                            between
                            the development agenda, agriculture, and green growth. In St. Petersburg (Russia) in 2013,
                            major
                            progress
                            was made on combating tax evasion and avoidance. The G20 agreed on the automatic exchange of
                            tax
                            information and the Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). This was
                            intended to
                            help
                            create a regulatory policy to oversee the activities of multinational businesses which were
                            engaging in
                            tax avoidance by minimizing profits and shifting profits outside the countries, where the
                            activities
                            deriving those profits are performed. At the Brisbane Summit (Australia) in 2014, the G20
                            set
                            itself
                            the ambitious goal of increasing its collective GDP by an additional two percent. Another
                            important
                            step was taken in the field of banking regulation wherein the Finance Ministers and Central
                            Bank
                            Governors endorsed the Common Reporting Standard for Automatic Exchange of Tax Information.
                            The
                            Leaders endorsed the ‘Brisbane 25 by 25’ goal which aimed at reducing the gender gap in the
                            labor
                            workforce by 25 percent by 2025.

                            At the Toronto Summit (Canada) in 2010, the G20 adopted directives to reduce sovereign debt.
                            The advanced industrial States pledged a reduction in their budget deficits and external
                            borrowing. G20 Leaders met again in 2010 in Seoul (Republic of Korea), where they adopted
                            stricter regulations for banks (Basel III Norms), as well as agreed on the reform of the
                            financial stakes and voting shares in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Seoul was also
                            a
                            milestone in the history of the G20. For the first time, development policy issues were on
                            the
                            Summit’s Agenda which came to be known as the ‘Seoul Consensus’. Development has since been
                            a standard part of the agenda of every subsequent Summit. At the heart of the work programme
                            of the G20 Summit in Cannes (France), in 2011, was the reform of the international monetary
                            system. G20 Leaders also agreed to establish the Agricultural Market Information System,
                            an inter-agency platform to enhance food market transparency and encourage international
                            policy coordination in times of crisis.

                            The first G20 Summit was held in 2008 in Washington DC (USA). It set the scene for the most
                            dramatic
                            reform of global finance in over 60 years. At the follow-up summit in 2009 in London (UK),
                            the
                            G20
                            agreed to blacklist states that refused to cooperate on efforts to tackle tax evasion and
                            avoidance.
                            In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the G20 resolved to impose stricter controls on
                            hedge
                            funds
                            and rating agencies. Institutional reforms included the expansion of the Financial Stability
                            Forum
                            (FSF) to make it an effective supervisory and watchdog body for the global financial system.
                            It
                            was
                            renamed the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The G20 is credited with helping avert a shift
                            to
                            protectionism in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. It also helped mobilize
                            consensus
                            for
                            tripling the International Monetary Fund’s budget and for expanding the mandate and lending
                            remit of
                            multilateral development banks. In 2008, in Washington DC, the G20 had agreed to refrain
                            from
                            imposing new barriers to trade and investment for 12 months. This 13 provision has been
                            extended
                            at
                            every subsequent summit. The G20 Summit in Pittsburgh (USA) in 2009 established the G20 as a
                            major
                            decision-making body on matters relating to the global economy. This summit decided on
                            stricter
                            regulations for the banking sector, requiring banks to retain a greater proportion of their
                            profits
                            to build capital. These measures helped reduce the financial risk to governments and
                            tax-payers
                            posed by high-risk private sector activities.
