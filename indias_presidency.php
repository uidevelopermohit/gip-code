                            India's G20 presidency has marked a significant milestone in its global leadership role. With, India taking 
                            the presidency for the first time, it is steering discussions and initiative’ among the world's major 
                            economies to address complex challenges. During the presidency, India has focussed on various issues like 
                            inclusive growth, digital innovation, climate resilience, and equitable global health access. By leveraging 
                            its presidency, India is fostering collaborative solutions that not only benefit its own population but 
                            contribute to the broader global well-being, reinforcing its spirit of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ or the 
                            ‘World is One Family’.

                        <p>
                            The G20 Logo draws inspiration from the vibrant colours of India’s national flag – saffron, white and 
                            green, and blue. It juxtaposes planet Earth with the lotus, India’s national flower that reflects growth 
                            amid challenges. The Earth reflects India’s pro-planet approach to life, one in perfect harmony with nature.
                            Below the G20 logo is “Bharat”, written in the Devanagari script. The theme of India’– G20 Presidency - 
                            “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” or “One Earth · One Fami–y · One Future” - is drawn from the ancient Sanskrit text 
                            of the Maha Upanishad. Essentially, the theme affirms the value of all life – human, animal, plant, and 
                            microorganisms – and their interconnectedness on the planet Earth and in the wider universe.

                            and responsible choices, both at the level of individual lifestyles as well as national development, leading 
                            to globally transformative actions resulting in a cleaner, greener and bluer future.

                        <p>
                            The logo and the theme together convey a powerful message of India’s G20 Presidency, which is of striving for 
                            just and equitable growth for all in the world, as we navigate through these turbulent times, in a sustainable, 
                            holistic, responsible, and inclusive manner. They represent a uniquely Indian approach to our G20 Presidency, 
                            of living in harmony with the surrounding ecosystem.

                            For India, the G20 Presidency also marks the beginning of “Amritkaal”, the 25-year period beginning from the
                            75th anniversary of its independence on 15 August 2022, leading up to the centenary of its independence, 
                            towards a futuristic, prosperous, inclusive and developed society, distinguished by a human-centric approach 
                            at its core.

                            India’s Presidency intends to drive meaningful action to accelerate ecosystem restoration along with other key 
                            issues. The discussions have covered financing mechanisms and frontier technologies to promote avenues such as

                                    The first G20 Summit was held in 2008 in Washington DC (USA). It set the scene for the most dramatic 
                                    reform of global finance in over 60 years. At the follow-up summit in 2009 in London (UK), the G20 
                                    agreed to blacklist states that refused to cooperate on efforts to tackle tax evasion and avoidance. 
                                    In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the G20 resolved to impose stricter controls on hedge 
                                    funds and rating agencies. Institutional reforms included the expansion of the Financial Stability 
                                    Forum (FSF) to make it an effective supervisory and watchdog body for the global financial system. 
                                    It was renamed the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The G20 is credited with helping avert a shift 
                                    to protectionism in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. It also helped mobilize consensus 
                                    for tripling the International Monetary Fund’s budget and for expanding the mandate and lending 
                                    remit of multilateral development banks. In 2008, in Washington DC, the G20 had agreed to refrain 
                                    from imposing new barriers to trade and investment for 12 months. This 13 provision has been 
                                    extended at every subsequent summit. The G20 Summit in Pittsburgh (USA) in 2009 established the 
                                    G20 as a major decision-making body on matters relating to the global economy. This summit decided 
                                    on stricter regulations for the banking sector, requiring banks to retain a greater proportion of 
                                    their profits to build capital. These measures helped reduce the financial risk to governments and 
                                    tax-payers posed by high-risk private sector activities.
