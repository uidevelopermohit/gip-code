                    <h6>Overview</h6>
                    <p>The GIR-GIP alliance for strengthening the G20 Global Land Initiative (GLI), is proposed as an
                        alliance of countries
                        led by national nodal institutions/experts/organizations to accelerate ecological restoration of
                        identified
                        priority landscapes viz. forest fire and mining affected areas which are biodiversity rich and
                        have
                        primarily
                        been degraded by anthropogenic causes.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Rationale for an Alliance</h6>
                    <p>The G20 voluntary target to achieve 50% reduction in degraded land by 2040 was set in 2020 under
                        the
                        Saudi Arabian
                        G20 Presidency and the G20 Global Land Initiative (GLI) was launched to help fulfill this
                        target.
                        The Indian G20
                        Presidency proposes an alliance of interested Country parties to contribute to strengthening the
                        implementation of
                        the G20 GLI and G20 voluntary target, by sharing knowledge and best practices, creating a
                        network of
                        experts and
                        identifying and supporting projects that can help unlock high impacts.

                    <p>The Agenda for eco-restoration of identified priority landscapes involves four key elements –
                    </p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Define the need - A clear articulation of the rationale
                        for
                        addressing
                        eco-restoration of selected landscapes is required to be familiarized at various multilateral
                        fora.</li>
                        <li>Gather support – Bilateral and multilateral fora need to
                        be
                        leveraged to
                        include new members into the alliance as well as drive global dialogue on the eco-restoration of
                        prioritized
                        landscapes.</li>
                        <li>Take collaborative action – The alliance needs to be used
                        as a
                        platform to
                        drive global action on prioritized landscapes by ensuring primacy of these landscapes in all
                        multilateral
                        discussions.</li>
                        <li>Showcase results – Regular reports on status of
                        initiatives
                        need to be
                        showcased at multilateral fora to showcase the work of the alliance while ensuring its
                        recognition
                        in the outcomes
                        of these fora.</li>

                    <h6>Proposed Structure</h6>
                    <p>The alliance will be governed by a 3-tier governance structure. </p>

                        the
                        alliance with a nominated HoD level officer from all countries with the mandate to represent the

                        implementing
                        alliance activities.</li>
                        <li>Expert Working Group – Senior level expert committee
                        nominated
                        by members of
                        the alliance coordination committee with 1 member on each priority landscape from each country
                        tasked with identifying and technically supporting lighthouse projects as well as finalizing the
                        annual restoration reports of the alliance.</li>
