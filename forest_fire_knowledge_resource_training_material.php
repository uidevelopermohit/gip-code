                                    The overall impact of large scale deforestation has been very devastating, while on one hand the indigenous people in the tropical forests have faced poverty and alienation due to diminishing supplies of forest products and farm yields, on the other; it caused immense loss to environment and ecology. There have been profound ecological effects of forest loss, as evident in the exacerbation of droughts and floods, release of heat trapping temperatures, advent of new pests into cropped lands, much sedimentation in riverbeds and hydroelectric reservoirs, and loss of productive fisheries.

                                        More than 90 percent forest fires all over the world are initiated due to anthropogenic activities, which majority is related to land use pattern. Conversion of forestland to agriculture, pastureland and plantation are the main eminent factors for such incidences. In tropics, two types of practices for conversion of forest land are common i.e. shifting cultivation and permanent conversion.
                                        Global initiatives are essential to deal with regional issues, like global climate change, rise of sea levels, melting of glaciers and forest fire. During the recent past forest fire has emerged as a severe problem adversely affecting the health and sustainability of the global vegetation. Keeping in view the severity of the problem, a need has been felt worldwide to evolve an effective strategy for fire management planning and practices by seeking international cooperation. It has been felt that communities, being the first responder, be engaged in its management vigorously and experience and expertise of countries be shared for capacity building of individual countries to effectively tackle the problem. Joint research and development network, especially in advancing knowledge about forest fire and in learning from one another's experience carry a lot of advantage and strengthen the prevailing system. Early warning techniques, use of satellite data, suppression techniques, sending experts at the time of fire breakout etc. are the field activities, where such cooperation may be of immense use and significance. In the case of severe fire, it is natural for friendly countries to share expertise and rush helpful agencies that carry rich experiences and could be of great service in the hours of need.

                                The Workshop largely focused on Strengthening of Forest Fire Management in the 26 most forest fire affected districts of India spread over 11 States. It also focused on preventing future forest fire outbreaks and ensuing effective and swift response towards this disaster. Keeping these in mind, various officers of MHA, NDMA, IAF, NDRF, FSI, ICFRE, IGNFA and MoEF & CC and Forest Departments of 11 states conducted sessions related to forest fire training, fire alerts and early warning, meteorological drivers of forest fire forecasting, issues and challenges of forest fire management, Global best practices on forest fire management, capacity and training constraints. In an attempt to chart a roadmap for generating awareness towards forest fires, various technical sessions on awareness to various problems and solutions related to forest fire management were held as a part of the one day workshop.

                                    The one-day consultative workshop on “National Programme on Forest Fire Management” was organized by the NDMA and MoEFCC in collaboration with the Himachal Pradesh Forest Department (HPFD) and Himalayan Forest Research Institute (HFRI) at HFRI, Shimla on 13 January 2023. The discussions and deliberations by over 60 participants mainly focused on the best practices in forest fire management, innovations, community engagement and issues of sustainable livelihoods. Another important aspect of discussion was the need for early warning, response, research, and training. The participants representing various organizations and agencies were all given an opportunity to share their opinions and experience, who also put in their interesting and innovative views, on this very sensitive issue of forest fire.

The forests of Central India are highly prone to forest fire and any management initiatives should be incomplete without addressing the Central Indian scenario.

                                                The study argues that a comprehensive assessment for forest fires by integrating climatological scenarios at a localised level can help mitigate forest fires better.

                                                The past decade has seen a significant surge in the incidence of large and uncontrolled wildfires. For example, in April 2020, the number of fire alerts around the world rose by 13% compared to 2019, a record year for fires.

                                            	Restoration of forest fire impacted areas- Karnataka Forest Department, India
                                                    Forest fire on a large scale changes the species composition due to proliferation of invasive alien weed species like Lantana camara. This results in suppression of native grass, herb, shrub and tree species in the long thereby reducing the biodiversity of forests.
